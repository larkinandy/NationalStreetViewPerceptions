TODO: add map showing distribution of national estimates.  Maybe one map with multiple panels, one panel for each perception?

# national estimates
Scripts and datasets for creating national US estimates of street view perceptions

**Summary** <br>
Methods for calculating TrueSkill scores and creating national US perception surfaces.  Steps include
1) Caculating multinomial trueskill scores from siamese neural network perception model outputs
2) Combining trueskill scores from multiple viewing angles into a single estimate for a single location
3) Joining trueskill scores with Google Street View metadata and creating a point geodatabase
4) Converting the point geodatabase into a set of rasters
5) Creating 500m and 1000m average estimates from the higher resolution raster created in step 4
